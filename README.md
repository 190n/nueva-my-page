nueva-my-page
=============

For [Nueva High School](https://nuevaschool.org), part of the application is a
"My Page":

> Nueva encourages students to develop a love of learning and to follow their
> passions. We ask our applicants to create a "My Page!" submission. This is an
> open-ended opportunity to creatively express whatever best captures your
> passions, and will tell us more about you. Using any medium that you choose,
> you may submit a poem, sketch a picture, make a collage, include a scene from
> a play, make a video, solve an equation, design a science experiment, etc.
> This is your opportunity to be creative and unique; there are no right
> answers, so have fun! Then, in a few sentences, tell us why you chose your
> “My Page!” submission. Your project should be a new creation for your Nueva
> application. Please don’t forget to include your name and applying grade on
> all parts. Note: submissions will not be returned.

I am developing an HTML5 game for this application.
